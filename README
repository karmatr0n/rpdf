== RPDF Template Plugin for Ruby on Rails ==

A plugin to allow the inclusion of ruby code into the RPDF template files,
and using the special object called 'pdf', this enables you to use methods 
of the pdf-writer gem.

Unlike conventional templates which are used to render the results of an
action in html, the templates will be rendered as a pdf document.

The rpdf templates end in .rpdf, for example: show.rpdf

Requirements:
gem install pdf-writer

== How to use ==

Edit your mime_types.rb initializer located under config/initializers and 
add the following line:
Mime::Type.register "application/pdf", :pdf

Example:

Edit your controller (app/controllers/people_controller.rb)
class PeopleController < ActionController
  def show
	@record = Person.find(:id)
	respond_to do |format|
	  	format.pdf { :render => 'show.rpdf' }
	end
  end
end

Edit your view (app/views/people/show.rpdf)

pdf.add_text(468, 671, @record.fullname, 10) # See for pdf-writer methods
j=0
@record.addresses.each do |address|
 pdf.add_text(85, 388 - 13*j, address.location, 10) #numeric order
 j += 1
end
